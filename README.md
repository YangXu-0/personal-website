# Personal Website

https://yangxu.ca/

I made a simple personal website with React, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS to highlight some things about me. The website is currently hosted with Firebase because it's free and I don't want to buy a domain name :)

The webpage contains a brief introduction to who I am, work history, contact information, and my resume.   

In the future, I'll probably add a section for projects I've done and maybe coursework.  

Mobile webpages are a work in progress.
